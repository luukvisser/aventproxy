"""Secret redaction shared by the debug log and the diagnostics dump.

docs/reporting-issues.md tells users their password, session token, email and
device keys are stripped before anything leaves their machine, and the issue
template repeats it while asking for the debug log. That promise has to hold
for both outputs, so both go through this one function.

Tuya discovery responses are the hard case: ``localKey`` — which is enough to
control the camera over the LAN on its own — sits inside lists of device dicts,
and household coordinates ride along in the home objects. Redaction therefore
walks lists as well as dicts.

No Home Assistant or aiohttp imports here, so the unit tests can load it
directly.
